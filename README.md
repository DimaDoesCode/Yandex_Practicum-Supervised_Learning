The mobile operator "Megaline" has found out that many of its customers are still using outdated tariff plans. They want to build a system that can analyze customer behavior and suggest a new tariff plan, either "Smart" or "Ultra".

You have access to data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these tariff plans (from the "Statistical Data Analysis" course project). Your task is to build a classification model that will select the appropriate tariff. You do not need to preprocess the data as it has already been done.

Build a model with the highest possible accuracy score. To successfully complete the project, you need to achieve at least 0.75 accuracy. You should check the accuracy on the test set yourself.
