<img src="https://github.com/DimaDoesCode/Yandex_Practicum-Supervised_Learning/raw/master/bank_churn.png" width="200" height="200" align="left"/>
Customers have started to leave Beta Bank. Every month. Not a lot, but it's noticeable. Bank marketers have calculated that it's cheaper to retain existing customers than to attract new ones.

We need to forecast whether a customer will leave the bank in the near future or not. You are provided with historical data on customer behavior and contract terminations with the bank.

Build a model with a maximized F1 score. To successfully complete the project, you need to achieve a metric of 0.59 for F1 score. Evaluate the F1 score on the test set independently.

Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC and compare its value with the F1 score.
