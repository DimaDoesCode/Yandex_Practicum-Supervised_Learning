# Introduction to Machine Learning
## Data
The following data is available:<br>
Each object in the dataset represents information about the behavior of one user over the course of one month. The following information is available:
<pre>'calls' — number of calls
'minutes' — total call duration in minutes
'messages' — number of SMS messages
'mb_used' — internet traffic used in MB
'is_ultra' — which plan the user was using during the month
             ("Ultra" — 1, "Smart" — 0)</pre>

## Task
The task at hand is to build a classification model that can select the appropriate tariff based on data about customer behavior for different tariffs.
